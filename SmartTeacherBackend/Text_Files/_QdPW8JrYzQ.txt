Translator Lalla Khadija Tigha Auditor muhammad Samir. A few years ago I received an unwanted email. It managed to break through the junk mail barrier. I don’t know how that happened, but it arrived in my inbox. It was from a man named Solomon, Udonkoh., (, Laughter ). I know. ( Laughter ). The dialogue was as follows. He said `` Hello, James Fitch. I have an interesting business proposal that I would like to share with you Solomon. ``. Now my hands were hovering around the `` Scan'' button right. I was looking at my phone. So I said I can just wipe this. Or to do what I think is the thing we've always wanted to do. ( Laughter ). So I said `` Solomon, your letter moved me.'', (, Laughter, ), (, clap, ). The game was launched., So he said: `` Dear James Fitch, we'll ship, the gold to you.'', ( Laughter, ) ``, You will earn 10 % for every gold. You distribute.'' ( Laughter ).

So I said oh --, Then he continued `` equivalent to 25 kilos. ( Laughter ). It will be worth 2.5 million dollars. ``. I said `` Solomon. If we're going to do this, let's do something bigger., (, clap ). I can do it. How much gold do you have `` ( Laughter ), He said ``. It is not a matter of how much gold I have. What matters is your absorption capacity.? We can start with 50 kilograms as a trial charge., So I said, 50 kilograms. There is no point in doing all of this. If we don't ship a full ton., ``, (, Laughter, ), (, clap ), So he said ``. What do you do? ?'' ( Laughter ), I said `` Executive Director of the bank's safeguard portfolios.'' ( Laughter ). This is not the first time that gold bars have been shipped to me, my friend, no no no. Then I started to feel terrified., So I said ``. Where are you ?''? I don’t know how to think, but I think if we use the mail service It must be registered. This is a lot of gold. ``. He said ``. It won't be easy to convince my company By shipping a large amount. ``. I said `` Solomon, I totally agree. I am in the process of developing an illustration to take it with you to the board meeting. wait.'' (, Laughter ). This is what I sent to Solomon. ( Laughter, ), (, clap ). I don’t know if we have any statisticians here, But there is definitely something. ( Laughter ). I said `` Solomon you'll find attached to this letter a chart that will help you. One of my assistants prepared the numbers. ( Laughter ). We are ready to ship as much gold as possible. ``. There is always a moment when your heart sings with joy. This was Solomon., He said ``. I would be very happy if the deal was made successfully Because I will get a good commission too. ”. So I said `` This is awesome. What will your share be spent ?''? He said `` On the property. What about you ?''? I thought about it long. So I said `` One word: chickpeas.'' ( Laughter, ) ``. This is common. (, Laughter ). I was in Sansbury one day There were 30 different types. You can chop the carrots and immerse them in them. Have you done this before Solomon ``, ( Laughter, )? He said ``. I have to go to sleep, now.'', (, Laughter, ), (, clap, ), ``, Tomorrow., sweet Dreams.''. I didn't know what to say So. I said `` Good evening: gold medal, good evening.'', (, Laughter, ) Guys. You have to be aware that this went on for weeks And if so far, the best weeks of my life I had to end up. Because he started getting out of control a little., My friends used to say `` James. Do you want to come with us to have a drink ?''? I replied ``. I can't. I'm waiting for an email on some gold.'', So I realized I had to end it. I had to take a trivial end., So I designed a plan. And I said, `` Solomon - I'm worried about security. When we write to each other. We have to use symbols. ``, He agreed. ( Laughter ). I said `` Solomon. I spent a whole night finding this symbol. We must use it in all of our next correspondence Attorney The rubber bear. Bank, scrambled eggs, Legal Ordered Coca Cola, Bottle M & amp M's, Chocolate Documents, jelly beans.

( Laughter ) Send out £ 1500 Across the giant rubber, lizard. ``, (, clap ). That was so funny right, Which made me think What will happen if you spend as much time as possible In response to these messages, as best I can. This is what I was doing For 3 years On your behalf. ( Laughter, ), (, clap, ), Crazy things happen when you start responding to spam., It is very difficult. I strongly encourage you to do. I don't think what I'm doing is mean. There are people who do ugly things to scammers. All I do is waste your time. I believe that every time they spend with me The time they don't spend on defrauding vulnerable adults, They waste their savings right And if you intend to do this, which I very much encourage you to do Get email addresses with aliases. Do not use your e-mail address. This was what I was doing in the beginning, and that was a nightmare. I was getting up in the morning to find thousands of messages About enlarging the penis. Only one response was a legitimate answer: -- ( Laughter ) For a medical question. I was asking., But I will tell you in return guys. I will tell you every day is a good day. Every day is a good day. When you receive a message, it begins as follows: ( Laughter, ) ``. I am Winnie Mandela. The second wife of Nelson Mandela, the former president of South Africa., So I said oh, this is Winnie Mandela., (, Laughter, ). I know many like her. ``. I need to transfer $ 45 million outside the country Because of the health of my husband, Nelson Mandela. ``. Let'S look at this a little. She sent me this, which was hysterical. (, Laughter ), and this is. From what seems somewhat legitimate. This is a letter of authorization., But, to be frank, there is nothing written on it. It is just a form, ( Laughter ). I said `` Winnie, I'm really sad to hear this. Since Nelson Mandela died 3 months ago. I would describe his health as very critical. `` (, Laughter ). This is the worst health condition that can happen to you not to be alive. She said ``, Please adhere to the bank's instructions., my only love'' ( Laughter ), So I said, `` Sure no women, no tears.'' ( Laughter, ), (, clap ). She said ``. The bank employee will need to transfer 3,000 dollars. My only love.'' ( Laughter ). So I said: `` No problem., You shot the chief of police. `` [ (, But I didn't shoot the deputy ) ] ( Laughter ) thank you., (, clap, )
