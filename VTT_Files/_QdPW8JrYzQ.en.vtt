00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:13.960
 A few years ago, 

00:00:13.984 --> 00:00:17.444
 I received an unwanted email. 

00:00:17.468 --> 00:00:19.572
 It managed to break through the junk mail barrier. 

00:00:19.596 --> 00:00:22.152
 I don’t know how that happened, but it arrived in my inbox, 

00:00:22.176 --> 00:00:24.325
 It was from a man named Solomon Udonkoh. 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:25.564
 (Laughter) 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:27.310
 I know. 

00:00:27.334 --> 00:00:28.564
 (Laughter) 

00:00:28.588 --> 00:00:29.748
 The dialogue was as follows: 

00:00:29.772 --> 00:00:31.390
 He said, "Hello James Fitch, 

00:00:31.414 --> 00:00:34.953
 I have an interesting business proposal that I would like to share with you, Solomon. " 

00:00:36.246 --> 00:00:39.159
 Now, my hands were hovering around the "Scan" button, right? 

00:00:39.183 --> 00:00:42.142
 I was looking at my phone, so I said, I can just wipe this. 

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:46.607
 Or to do what I think is the thing we've always wanted to do. 

00:00:46.631 --> 00:00:49.622
 (Laughter) 

00:00:50.541 --> 00:00:52.750
 So I said, "Solomon, your letter moved me." 

00:00:52.774 --> 00:00:55.476
 (Laughter) 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.476
 (clap) 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.920
 The game was launched. 

00:01:05.214 --> 00:01:08.175
 So he said, "Dear James Fitch, we'll ship the gold to you." 

00:01:08.199 --> 00:01:09.896
 (Laughter) 

00:01:10.302 --> 00:01:13.199
 "You will earn 10% for every gold you distribute." 

00:01:13.223 --> 00:01:14.987
 (Laughter) 

00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:17.358
 I knew then that I was dealing with a professional. 

00:01:17.382 --> 00:01:20.957
 (Laughter) 

00:01:22.408 --> 00:01:23.892
 I said, "What is its value?" 

00:01:25.058 --> 00:01:27.558
 He said: "We will start with a small amount," - 

00:01:27.582 --> 00:01:28.734
 So I said, oh-- 

00:01:28.758 --> 00:01:31.552
 Then he continued, "equivalent to 25 kilos. 

00:01:31.576 --> 00:01:33.576
 (Laughter) 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:37.433
 It will be worth 2.5 million dollars. " 

00:01:39.536 --> 00:01:42.211
 I said, "Solomon, if we're going to do this, let's do something bigger. 

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:49.137
 (clap) 

00:01:50.286 --> 00:01:54.191
 I can do it. How much gold do you have? " 

00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:57.302
 (Laughter) 

00:01:57.761 --> 00:02:00.601
 He said: "It is not a matter of how much gold I have, what matters is your absorption capacity. 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.683
 We can start with 50 kilograms as a trial charge. 

00:02:04.707 --> 00:02:06.578
 So I said, 50 kilograms? 

00:02:06.602 --> 00:02:09.915
 There is no point in doing all of this if we don't ship a full ton. " 

00:02:10.523 --> 00:02:11.718
 (Laughter) 

00:02:11.742 --> 00:02:14.511
 (clap) 

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:17.324
 So he said, "What do you do?" 

00:02:17.348 --> 00:02:19.203
 (Laughter) 

00:02:20.283 --> 00:02:22.625
 I said, "Executive Director of the bank's safeguard portfolios." 

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:26.057
 (Laughter) 

00:02:27.123 --> 00:02:29.953
 This is not the first time that gold bars have been shipped to me, my friend, 

00:02:29.993 --> 00:02:31.178
 no no no. 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.140
 Then I started to feel terrified. 

00:02:34.164 --> 00:02:35.382
 So I said, "Where are you?" 

00:02:35.386 --> 00:02:38.104
 I don’t know how to think, but I think if we use the mail service 

00:02:38.104 --> 00:02:39.422
 It must be registered 

00:02:40.046 --> 00:02:41.490
 This is a lot of gold. " 

00:02:42.666 --> 00:02:45.103
 He said, "It won't be easy to convince my company 

00:02:45.127 --> 00:02:46.837
 By shipping a large amount. " 

00:02:46.861 --> 00:02:49.389
 I said, "Solomon, I totally agree. 

00:02:49.413 --> 00:02:52.859
 I am in the process of developing an illustration, to take it with you to the board meeting. 

00:02:52.883 --> 00:02:54.063
 wait." 

00:02:54.087 --> 00:02:57.116
 (Laughter) 

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:02.356
 This is what I sent to Solomon. 

00:03:03.205 --> 00:03:05.332
 (Laughter) 

00:03:05.356 --> 00:03:11.268
 (clap) 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.884
 I don’t know if we have any statisticians here, 

00:03:14.908 --> 00:03:16.917
 But there is definitely something. 

00:03:16.941 --> 00:03:18.575
 (Laughter) 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.450
 I said, "Solomon, you'll find attached to this letter, a chart that will help you. 

00:03:23.281 --> 00:03:25.574
 One of my assistants prepared the numbers. 

00:03:25.598 --> 00:03:27.384
 (Laughter) 

00:03:27.408 --> 00:03:29.789
 We are ready to ship as much gold as possible. " 

00:03:30.254 --> 00:03:32.495
 There is always a moment when your heart sings with joy, 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.301
 This was Solomon. 

00:03:34.325 --> 00:03:36.572
 He said, "I would be very happy if the deal was made successfully, 

00:03:36.586 --> 00:03:38.661
 Because I will get a good commission, too. ” 

00:03:38.685 --> 00:03:41.729
 So I said, "This is awesome. What will your share be spent?" 

00:03:42.363 --> 00:03:44.983
 He said, "On the property, what about you?" 

00:03:46.133 --> 00:03:49.180
 I thought about it long. 

00:03:50.625 --> 00:03:52.174
 So I said, "One word, 

00:03:53.632 --> 00:03:54.783
 chickpeas." 

00:03:54.807 --> 00:03:57.988
 (Laughter) 

00:04:00.261 --> 00:04:01.411
 "This is common. 

00:04:01.435 --> 00:04:02.618
 (Laughter) 

00:04:03.235 --> 00:04:04.855
 I was in Sansbury one day 

00:04:04.855 --> 00:04:06.548
 There were 30 different types. 

00:04:06.602 --> 00:04:10.039
 You can chop the carrots, and immerse them in them. 

00:04:10.063 --> 00:04:11.919
 Have you done this before, Solomon? " 

00:04:11.943 --> 00:04:13.943
 (Laughter) 

00:04:14.458 --> 00:04:15.990
 He said, "I have to go to sleep now." 

00:04:16.014 --> 00:04:18.893
 (Laughter) 

00:04:18.917 --> 00:04:21.776
 (clap) 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.177
 "Tomorrow. 

00:04:24.407 --> 00:04:25.559
 sweet Dreams." 

00:04:25.583 --> 00:04:26.971
 I didn't know what to say! 

00:04:27.643 --> 00:04:30.530
 So I said, "Good evening, gold medal, good evening." 

00:04:30.554 --> 00:04:32.855
 (Laughter) 

00:04:33.323 --> 00:04:35.575
 Guys, you have to be aware that this went on, for weeks, 

00:04:35.609 --> 00:04:37.864
 And if so far, the best weeks of my life, 

00:04:37.864 --> 00:04:39.265
 I had to end up. 

00:04:39.265 --> 00:04:40.769
 Because he started getting out of control a little. 

00:04:40.769 --> 00:04:43.695
 My friends used to say, "James, do you want to come with us to have a drink?" 

00:04:43.695 --> 00:04:46.881
 I replied, "I can't. I'm waiting for an email on some gold." 

00:04:46.895 --> 00:04:48.513
 So I realized I had to end it. 

00:04:48.513 --> 00:04:50.043
 I had to take a trivial end. 

00:04:50.043 --> 00:04:51.319
 So I designed a plan. 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:54.655
 And I said, "Solomon, I'm worried about security. 

00:04:54.655 --> 00:04:56.426
 When we write to each other, 

00:04:56.426 --> 00:04:58.027
 We have to use symbols. " 

00:05:00.582 --> 00:05:01.733
 He agreed. 

00:05:01.757 --> 00:05:03.145
 (Laughter) 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.578
 I said, "Solomon, I spent a whole night finding this symbol 

00:05:05.872 --> 00:05:07.917
 We must use it in all of our next correspondence: 

00:05:08.001 --> 00:05:11.954
 Attorney: The rubber bear. 

00:05:13.564 --> 00:05:14.983
 Bank: scrambled eggs 

00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:18.249
 Legal: Ordered Coca Cola Bottle: M &amp; M's Chocolate 

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:19.517
 Documents: jelly beans. 

00:05:19.517 --> 00:05:22.281
 Western Union: the huge rubber orchid. 

00:05:22.305 --> 00:05:24.137
 (Laughter) 

00:05:24.232 --> 00:05:26.993
 I know these are all the words they use, right? 

00:05:27.052 --> 00:05:30.637
 I said, "Please call me" Kit Kat "in all of our next correspondence. 

00:05:30.661 --> 00:05:34.724
 (Laughter) 

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:38.430
 I did not receive a response. I thought I had gone too far. 

00:05:38.454 --> 00:05:40.796
 You have gone too far. I had to back off a little. 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.105
 I said, "Solomon, is the show still standing? 

00:05:44.311 --> 00:05:45.462
 kit Kat." 

00:05:45.486 --> 00:05:46.732
 (Laughter) 

00:05:46.756 --> 00:05:48.628
 Because you have to be consistent with your principles. 

00:05:51.208 --> 00:05:52.968
 Then I received a message from him. 

00:05:52.968 --> 00:05:55.282
 He said, "The work is going on, and I try to etc etc etc ..." 

00:05:55.282 --> 00:05:58.280
 I said, "Man, you have to use the symbol!" 

00:06:01.478 --> 00:06:04.066
 What followed was the greatest message I ever received. 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.272
 (Laughter) 

00:06:07.675 --> 00:06:10.221
 I'm not kidding, that's what I got on my mailbox. 

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:12.089
 It was a wonderful day. 

00:06:13.224 --> 00:06:14.375
 "The work is still going on. 

00:06:16.065 --> 00:06:18.684
 I'm trying to get a rubber bear stabilizer-- 

00:06:18.708 --> 00:06:20.107
 (Laughter) 

00:06:23.365 --> 00:06:26.710
 In order to be able to put all the necessary cola bottles and jelly beans necessary 

00:06:26.734 --> 00:06:27.887
 For scrambled eggs, 

00:06:29.791 --> 00:06:32.094
 So that M &amp; M's can get started. 

00:06:32.118 --> 00:06:33.497
 (Laughter) 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.069
 Send out £ 1500 

00:06:36.093 --> 00:06:41.952
 Across the giant rubber lizard. " 

00:06:41.952 --> 00:06:45.275
 (clap) 

00:06:49.392 --> 00:06:51.797
 That was so funny, right, 

00:06:51.821 --> 00:06:53.171
 Which made me think: 

00:06:53.195 --> 00:06:56.106
 What will happen if you spend as much time as possible? 

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:58.224
 In response to these messages as best I can? 

00:07:00.145 --> 00:07:03.121
 This is what I was doing 

00:07:03.145 --> 00:07:05.245
 For 3 years 

00:07:05.269 --> 00:07:06.550
 On your behalf. 

00:07:06.574 --> 00:07:08.969
 (Laughter) 

00:07:08.993 --> 00:07:11.312
 (clap) 

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:14.950
 Crazy things happen when you start responding to spam. 

00:07:14.974 --> 00:07:16.125
 It is very difficult, 

00:07:16.149 --> 00:07:17.727
 I strongly encourage you to do. 

00:07:17.751 --> 00:07:19.592
 I don't think what I'm doing is mean. 

00:07:19.616 --> 00:07:22.368
 There are people who do ugly things to scammers. 

00:07:22.392 --> 00:07:25.979
 All I do is waste your time. 

00:07:26.894 --> 00:07:29.053
 I believe that every time they spend with me 

00:07:29.077 --> 00:07:31.674
 The time they don't spend on defrauding vulnerable adults 

00:07:31.698 --> 00:07:33.071
 They waste their savings, right? 

00:07:33.584 --> 00:07:37.051
 And if you intend to do this - which I very much encourage you to do - 

00:07:37.051 --> 00:07:39.242
 Get email addresses with aliases. 

00:07:39.242 --> 00:07:40.810
 Do not use your e-mail address. 

00:07:40.834 --> 00:07:43.032
 This was what I was doing in the beginning, and that was a nightmare. 

00:07:43.032 --> 00:07:45.132
 I was getting up in the morning to find thousands of messages 

00:07:45.132 --> 00:07:46.463
 About enlarging the penis, 

00:07:46.463 --> 00:07:49.720
 Only one response was a legitimate answer-- 

00:07:49.744 --> 00:07:51.840
 (Laughter) 

00:07:51.864 --> 00:07:53.206
 For a medical question I was asking. 

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:54.753
 But I will tell you, in return, guys, 

00:07:54.753 --> 00:07:58.024
 I will tell you: every day is a good day, every day is a good day 

00:07:58.048 --> 00:08:00.469
 When you receive a message, it begins as follows: 

00:08:01.558 --> 00:08:04.372
 (Laughter) 

00:08:04.396 --> 00:08:06.189
 "I am Winnie Mandela, 

00:08:07.004 --> 00:08:09.862
 The second wife of Nelson Mandela, the former president of South Africa. 

00:08:09.862 --> 00:08:12.315
 So I said, oh this is Winnie Mandela. 

00:08:12.339 --> 00:08:13.420
 (Laughter) 

00:08:13.444 --> 00:08:14.594
 I know many like her. 

00:08:15.546 --> 00:08:18.602
 "I need to transfer $ 45 million outside the country 

00:08:18.626 --> 00:08:21.396
 Because of the health of my husband Nelson Mandela. " 

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:22.579
 Let's look at this a little. 

00:08:23.864 --> 00:08:26.504
 She sent me this which was hysterical. 

00:08:26.528 --> 00:08:29.475
 (Laughter) 

00:08:29.499 --> 00:08:30.658
 and this is. 

00:08:30.682 --> 00:08:33.145
 From what seems somewhat legitimate, this is a letter of authorization. 

00:08:33.145 --> 00:08:35.754
 But to be frank, there is nothing written on it, it is just a form! 

00:08:36.008 --> 00:08:39.171
 (Laughter) 

00:08:39.611 --> 00:08:41.587
 I said, "Winnie, I'm really sad to hear this. 

00:08:41.587 --> 00:08:43.554
 Since Nelson Mandela died 3 months ago, 

00:08:43.554 --> 00:08:46.620
 I would describe his health as very critical. " 

00:08:46.644 --> 00:08:49.458
 (Laughter) 

00:08:49.482 --> 00:08:53.001
 This is the worst health condition that can happen to you, not to be alive. 

00:08:55.373 --> 00:08:58.144
 She said, "Please adhere to the bank's instructions. 

00:08:58.168 --> 00:08:59.326
 my only love" 

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.302
 (Laughter) 

00:09:02.325 --> 00:09:04.143
 So I said, "Sure, no women, no tears." 

00:09:04.167 --> 00:09:07.671
 (Laughter) 

00:09:07.695 --> 00:09:11.191
 (clap) 

00:09:12.701 --> 00:09:15.852
 She said, "The bank employee will need to transfer 3,000 dollars. My only love." 

00:09:15.876 --> 00:09:18.010
 (Laughter) 

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:21.979
 So I said, "No problem. 

00:09:24.262 --> 00:09:25.953
 You shot the chief of police. " 

00:09:29.813 --> 00:09:31.693
 [(But I didn't shoot the deputy)] 

00:09:31.717 --> 00:09:32.742
 (Laughter) 

00:09:32.766 --> 00:09:33.918
 thank you. 

00:09:33.942 --> 00:09:47.205
 (clap)
