00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.439
 However, many of them remain due to the protective elements present in the liquid that surrounds them 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.720
 Then the sperm must make its way through the cervix to the womb 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.260
 Usually the cervix remains tightly closed, but in this case it is open for days, which is the ovulation period for a woman 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.500
 Sperm swim through cervical mucus which weakened to more aqueous consistency to facilitate passage 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:12.389
 Once inside the cervix the sperm continues to swim towards the uterus even though millions will die trying to make it through mucus 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:20.669
 Some sperms remain trapped in the cervical folds, but may then continue as a precautionary journey to the first group 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.509
 Intrauterine muscle uterine contractions assist the sperm on their journey towards the egg 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:38.059
 Non-resident cells of a woman's immune system mistaking sperm for foreign invaders, destroying thousands of others 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:52.639
 The second half of the sperm head of the fallopian tube is empty while the other half swims towards a tube containing the unfertilized egg 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.150
 right Now 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.150
 Only a few thousand stay 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.550
 Inside the fallopian tubes, small cilia of eggs pushed towards the uterus 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.559
 To follow the sperm, you must rise against this movement to reach the egg 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.100
 Some sperm get trapped in cilia and die 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:18.259
 During this part of the chemicals a trip into the reproductive system causes the membranes covering the sperm's heads to change 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.139
 As a result, the sperm becomes overactive 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.290
 Swim stronger and faster towards their destination 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.289
 At long last wait the spam hit the eggs 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.579
 Only a few dozen of the original 300 million sperm remain 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.109
 The eggs are covered with a layer of cells called corona radiata 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.160
 The sperm must be pushed through this layer to reach the outer layer of the transparent Zona egg 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.100
 When the sperm reached the transparent zona they attached to the specialized sperm receptors on the surface 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.879
 That releases acrosomes to release digestive enzymes 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.239
 Enable sperm to dig into a layer 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.109
 Inside the transparent region are fluids that fill the narrow space outside the egg cell membrane 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.199
 The first sperm to make and contact fertilization of the egg 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.540
 After an incredibly risky and adventurous trip, one sperm attaches to an egg cell membrane 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.660
 Within a few minutes the outer membranes of the valves and eggs pull the sperm inside 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.259
 This event causes changes in the egg membrane that prevents other sperm from sticking to it 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.959
 Next chemicals releases eggs that push other sperm away from the eggs 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.440
 And creating an impenetrable fertilization membrane 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:57.000
 As the transparent reaction spreads outside the zona hardens trapping any sperm is unlucky enough to be caught inside 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.840
 Outside the eggs, the sperm are no longer able to attach to the transparent, zona 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.620
 At the same time inside the egg the male genetic material tightly packed spreads out 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.880
 For new membrane forms around the genetic material creating the male prokaryotic nucleus 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.320
 Inside repairs the genetic material in chromosomes 23 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.209
 The female genetic material woke up merging the sperm with the egg ending division 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.790
 Resulting in the progenitor of the female nucleus, which also contains 23 chromosomes 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.920
 Male and female pronuclei also formed 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.960
 Spider threads like the Internet called Microtubules pull them towards each other 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.349
 She joined two sets of chromosomes together 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:59.219
 Completion of the fertilization process at this moment creates a unique genetic code 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:05.878
 Instantly determine gender, hair color, eye color and hundreds of other characteristics 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.359
 This new single cell, the fertilized egg is the beginning of a new person 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:18.389
 And now the cilia of the fallopian tubes gently sweep the fertilized egg towards the uterus 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:21.658
 Where he or she will transplant into the endometrium richer 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.369
 Growth and maturity in the next nine months to be ready for birth
